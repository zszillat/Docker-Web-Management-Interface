passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
# Passlib 1.7.4 is not compatible with bcrypt 5.x (missing __about__ attribute
# and stricter length checks), so pin bcrypt to a 4.x release that Passlib
# supports. Without this pin, hashing any password fails with "password cannot
# be longer than 72 bytes" even for short inputs like "admin".
